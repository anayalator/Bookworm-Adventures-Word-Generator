Summary:

Letters
The amount of damage a word causes is based on its adjusted word length. The pips on the letter tiles give clues about their values.

A, E, I, O, U, D, G, L, N, R, S and T (bronze pips) count as 1 letter.
B, C, F, H, M and P (silver pips) count as 1.25 letters.
V, W and Y (silver pips) count as 1.5 letters.
J and K (gold pips) count as 1.75 letters.
X and Z (gold pips) count as 2 letters.
Qu (gold pip) counts as 2.75 letters.

Letter bonuses are tallied and rounded up to achieve the adjusted word length. So, for example, WAXY would count as W(1.5) + A(1) + X(2) + Y(1.5) for an adjusted word length of 6 letters in total. The adjusted word lengths then translate into base attack damages to foes:

Gems
Amethyst gem (purple) - Poisons enemy for two turns, adds 15% damage to the word.
Emerald gem (green) - Heals Lex for two hearts, adds 20% damage to the word.
Sapphire gem (blue) - Freezes enemy for 1 turn, adds 25% damage to the word.
Garnet gem (orange) - Weakens the enemy's attack for two turns, adds 30% damage to the word.
Ruby gem (red) - Sets enemy on fire for three turns, adds 35% damage to the word.
Crystal gem (bright pink) - Purifies Lex and the grid, shields Lex from damage for 1 turn, adds 50% damage to word.
Diamond gem (white) - Fully heals Lex, gives one of each potion type, adds 100% damage to word.
Gem tiles are cumulative in their effects. So, for instance, if you use an Emerald gem (20% damage boost) and a Ruby gem (35% damage boost) in a word, then Lex will be healed for two hearts, the enemy will be set on fire for three turns, and the word's power will be boosted by 20% + 35%, or 55%.
